									<h1>New Model for Offshore Wind
										Site Suitability Analysis</h1>
									<p>I have completed my MSc dissertation, which presents a new model for evaluating fixed platform offshore wind site suitability. 
										It uses an integrated GIS approach in conjunction with stakeholder engagement and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to find the best places for offshore wind farms in Ireland!</p>

								<p>Ireland has outlined some ambitious renewable energy goals, aiming for 5 GW of offshore renewable energy by 2030 and full climate neutrality by 2050. Offshore wind energy can be a powerful tool to achieve this goal, and developers are currently in the planning phase for the construction of four new offshore wind farms.</p>
								<p>All four of these wind farms (Dublin Array, Codling Wind Park, Tonn Nua, and North Irish Sea Array) will be using fixed platform foundations, meaning that they will be rigidly attached to the seafloor. This technology is currently the only foundation type being considered for development in Ireland as it has a proven and reliable track record compared to the alternative, which is floating foundations. However, the majority of research into Irish site suitability has focused on floating turbine foundations, as these are seen as the long run solution. While this may be true, as long as fixed foundation projects are in the development pipeline, it is important to know where to put them in order to ensure their success. And recent events have shown that our understanding of fixed foundation site suitability could be significantly misunderstood!</p>
								<p>I say this because the planners of a sixth Irish wind farm, Scierde Rocks, abruptly canceled their preparations in April of 2025, citing poor site suitability as a primary reason for the project’s failure. This project was valued at almost 1.5 billion dollars, and it was reported that the Irish government lost a 30 million dollar bond when the project went down. Because of events like this, it’s my opinion that as long as billion dollar projects are in the development pipeline, it is extremely important to be confident that we know where to put them.
</p>
								<p>In my dissertation, I built a dynamic model that uses Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis and GIS to combine 11 different site suitability factors and create a cohesive map of fixed platform wind farm viability in the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone. I then went on to calibrate this model by interviewing some of the leading experts in the industry. 
</p>
								<p>This model is also dynamic, so a user can easily change the importance hierarchy of the different variables considered by the model. This means that if a developer has a strong preference to avoid areas where fisheries conflicts might occur, but isn’t too worried about building in deeper waters, they can use my model to make a bespoke suitability map tailored to these preferences!
</p>
								<p>This model draws from similar studies that have been published in other countries such as Turkey, Greece, and Spain, yet it is the first for fixed platform offshore wind in Ireland! If you are interested in this model, I’ve linked my dissertation below. Please feel free to reach out to me via my email linked below. Happy wind farming!
